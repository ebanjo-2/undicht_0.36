the libraries used in the undicht engine

the library files may have to be rebuild when moving to a new operating system 
place them along with the needed include files in the /undicht/ folder for each library
some libraries may not need to be build (header only)
also it may be easier to get the files you need from the web (i.e. glad) then to build the project in some cases
